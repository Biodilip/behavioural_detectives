# Model parametrization and observations

## Parameters

These were derived primarly from Hargrave *et al*, 2011 and also the HIV Harare tutorial.

Base parameters:

* *Beta* = 0.2/30 (Scaled to match transmission over a year)
* Years spent in I compartment = 10; rate = 1/10
* Boxcars = 1 and 4
* Closed population - *mu*=*nu*

## Model - No het; No mod

* Boxcar = 1 - base model - Prevalence rises fast 

* Boxcar = 4 - 

## Model - Het +; No mod

* alpha = 4.5
* Boxcar = 1 - 
* Boxcar = 4 - 

## Model - No Het; Mod +

* q=4
* Boxcar = 1 - 
* Boxcar = 4 - 

* q=10
* Boxcar = 1 - 
* Boxcar = 4 - 

## Model - Het +; Mod +

* alpha = 4.5
* q = 4
* Boxcar = 1 - 
* Boxcar = 4 - 

* alpha = 4.5
* q = 10
* Boxcar = 1 - 
* Boxcar = 4 -
