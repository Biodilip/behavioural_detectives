# Notes on Hargrave *et al*, 2011

* Read Hargrave paper - HIV prev. in perinatal women in Harare - attempt to reproduce results - Notes:
    - Age strat. data
    - S and I model
    _ Data from multiple studies - observation errors possible
    - Open population model - Figure 1
    - Population growth based on 15 year difference
    - lambda changed exponentially over time at alpha x prev. of infection
    - mortality d/t d'se - Weibull survivorship curve - not exponential waiting time
    - Damping by total infections
    - Deaths - incident deaths vs cumulative deaths - interesting to try out?
    - Discrete time model?
    - What is bN (t-25)?
    - lambda is a logistic function that changes with time  to account for awareness and behaviour change programs - b is a fit parameter
    - lambda is an decreasing exp. function relating to deaths - people's awareness of deaths d/t HIV
    - Separate model for age stratifies data - P(t)?
    - Mortality estimated by fitting exp function to declining mortality prior to AIDS and then extrapolating, followed by sunbtracting HOV mort. from this
    - HIV prev. increased from early 80s, peaked in 1998 and declined till 2009
    - AIDS mort. increased form late 80s, peaked in 2001.
    - Fig 2A - prev decreased d/t behaviour mods
    - Fig 2B - prev. decreased d/t deaths
