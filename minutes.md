* Goals - define minimum goals, optimum goals, stretch goals
* HIV in Harare - explore behaviour modifications - distinguish differences in behavior in relation to reporting
* Heterogeneity - Age at onset of infection
* Multi-group models vs Pathogen agnostic models
* NOT Individual based models - not recommended
* Discussed Hargrave paper
* Discussed Ppt template - put in markdown

## Suggested Action points and way forward on analysis - Hargrave 2011

* Reproduce paper results with het
* Figure 2B - if het in modelling, turn-over should be explained. Why does it not better fit the data? Cos het as described by eqn 1
* Figure 2A - reproduce this in shiny app
* Implement SI in R and reproduce the results examining het
* Include cumulative deaths
* Look at more than one disease

## Task allocation

* R code - Cameline
* Lit review - Look at Sam's suggestions - forecasting paper, Jason Asher paper - Martha, everyone
* Shiny app - "scientific study" to try to fit data and extract parameters and understand - Dilip and MK
* Other lit suggestions - Sam
* Fill in template - Dilip

Effects to be investigated:

Model 1 - Heterogeneity

Model 2 - Behavior

Model 3 - Both


Tasks:
Cameline - push completed functions - completed
MK and Dilip- review code 
Martha - look into MLE

# Minutes  05 July 2023, 12:00

Analysis plan:
Settings - Base case parameters for HIV and Ebola
Varying over a range of parameters

Action - 
1. Dilip to create an analysis plan based on the setting and effects
2. Cameline and MK to review the code (dynamic n)
3. Martha to start working on MLE function
