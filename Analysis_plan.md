# Analysis plan
# Behavior modifications vs. Heterogeneity

## Question: Can we distinguish effects of heterogeneity v behaviour modifications in 2 different settings

## Setting 1 - data from HIV - Harare? South Africa?

* Characteristics of setting and variations
    - Model extended waiting times in the I compartment using boxcar models
    - *Look at multiple variations of total time in I?*
    - Examine effects of different no.s of boxcars in the model

* Heterogeneity
    - As a function of prevalence
    - *As a function of cumulative incidence*
    - *As a function of a cumulative deaths - death compartment for memory?*

* Behaviour
    - As a function of mortality

* Heterogeneity x Behaviour

* Parameters to look at
    - decline of disease transmission with mortality
    - FOI
    - effect of behaviour change in response to mortality
    - initial prevalence

## Setting 2 - modelling Ebola

* Characteristics of setting and variations
    - S, I, R and D?
    - Model extended waiting times in the S compartment to account for different rates of infection?
    - Examine effects of different no.s of boxcars in the model

* Heterogeneity
    - As a function of prevalence
    - *As a function of cumulative incidence* - cumulative incidence in discrete time steps?

* Behaviour
    - As a function of mortality

* Heterogeneity x Behaviour

* Parameters to look at
    - FOI
    - effect of behaviour change in response to mortality
    - decline of disease transmission with mortality
