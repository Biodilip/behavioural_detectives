# Analysis plan
# Behavior modifications vs. Heterogeneity

## Question: Can we distinguish effects of heterogeneity v behaviour modifications in 2 different settings

## Setting 1 - HIV - simulate data with fixed boxcars (3,6,9?) with het and behavioural modifications combined

* Characteristics of setting and variations
    - Model extended waiting times in the I compartment using boxcar models

* Test the above against the following:

* Heterogeneity
    - As a function of prevalence
    - *As a function of cumulative incidence - ?*

* Behaviour
    - As a function of mortality
    - *As a function of a cumulative deaths - death compartment for memory?*

* Heterogeneity x Behaviour

* Parameters to look at
    - decline of disease transmission with mortality
    - effect of behaviour change in response to mortality
    - initial prevalence

* Construct plot with parameters against the FOI (or others)

## Setting 2 - Ebola - simulate with different disease params and boxcars in S

* Characteristics of setting and variations
    - S, I, R
    - Model extended waiting times in the S compartment to account for different rates of infection?
    - Examine effects of different no.s of boxcars in the model

* Heterogeneity
    - As a function of prevalence

* Behaviour
    - As a function of mortality
    - *As a function of time to isolation?*
    - *As a function of cumulative incidence* - cumulative incidence in discrete time steps?

* Heterogeneity x Behaviour

* Parameters to look at
    - effect of behaviour change in response to mortality
    - decline of disease transmission with mortality
    - initial no. of cases

* Construct plot with parameters against the FOI (or others)
* justification for base parameters
*
